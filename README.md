# Gym Management

## Abstract 

the Gym Management System is a software that handles the
entire data of the Gym. It makes the work of a Fitness Manager very easy instead of
writing data in a notebook. In past, the gym managers were using notebooks to write
the data along with customersâ€™ names who purchased the gym memberships. So, it
was very difficult to keep track of each and every record.

If a Gym Manager wants to search for a particular gym record, then that task was very
time-consuming. So, to make this task easy the programming languages were
developed and the C++ language is one of them.
